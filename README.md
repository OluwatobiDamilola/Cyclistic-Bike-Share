The objective of this project is to derive insights from Cyclistic bike-share client data. These insights would empower the Cyclistic executive team to make data-driven decisions geared toward changing casual riders into annual members.
# About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, The Director of Marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Director of Marketing believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Director of Marketing has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Director of Marketing and her team are
interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# Scenerio
As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

# Data Processing,Manipulation and Analysis
The volume of this data is too large that spreadsheet and excel can't handle it. i used my most preferred tool Python for this project.
The step by step process taken to clean this data can be seen 

# Data Visualisation

Annual member rides makes 56.7% and casual riders make up 43.3% of the total rides. this shows that there are more annual members than casual members.

There is a usual increase in rides during the summer season(June-September) with casual members taking most rides in the beginning of the summer and drastic reduction in rides say during winter seasons(December_February).

 Annual members make more use of the bikes to commute to work and other places during week days while casual riders make use of the bikes often during weekends for leisure or other personal activities, they contribute the major users of the bikes at weekends.

Both Annual members and Casual riders use electric-bikes but more of classic-bikes. while Annual members never made use of docked-bikes except for a portion of the casual riders.

# Recommendation 
An attractive discount should be made for membership subscription during the beggining of the summer which include a free or little charge for weekend rides as this would attract casual riders to become annual members.
There should be a monthly give-away or bonanza which would involve casual riders to register as an annual member and get free ride pass for two days during the weekend, since casual riders ride more during the weekend.
Marketing adverts should target all stations, gyms, public places, forums, facebook groups, twitter community, bikers community, schools, fields, parks,grocery stores, movie theatre and cinemas among others to capture the attention and make the target audience aware of this deals.
